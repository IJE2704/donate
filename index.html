                <h2>Their lives depend on your donation</h2>
                <p>At times many families are dying of starvation.Your donation puts a smile on a family's face. They can at
                    least eat and stay healthy. It is not possible for us to reach all families by ourselves. Delivering
                    food to all families is a challenge.And that's why we need your help.</p>

                <p>Many roads are flooded. It is not possible for him to travel through those roads.Walking on this road, the water is as high as your head in some places. Because of that, small children cannot go to school. In many of my places schools are flooded.And so we should deliver education to them.</p>
